Over the last decade I have been trying to grasp over what OpenPGP and GnuPG
actually are. I was not sure about how’s and why’s of the technology, which is
why I have accumulated a lot of various OpenPGP keys. Some of them are too
small, some are long expired, some have weak passwords, and some are completely
inaccessible.

In order not to confuse other people and to finally establish my online
identity, I have set up a new OpenPGP key. From now on, this will be my primary
key, and I will be transitioning my old ones.

All the old keys mentioned here will be set to expire on 01 January 2022.
I strongly request anyone wanting to contact me to use my new key. I would also
like my new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.

To certify the transition, this message is signed using (almost; see note) every
one of my old keys as well as the new key.


The old keys, sorted by their age (oldest first):

    pub   rsa4096/0x5B7BB75B9D6A32FE 2019-02-15
          Key fingerprint = 9BC6 68B5 0C4F 0168 F5DB  2D7F 5B7B B75B 9D6A 32FE

    pub   rsa4096/0x82869D5D93513BF3 2019-06-02
          Key fingerprint = BCE9 83A5 624C 7BD6 7591  21FE 8286 9D5D 9351 3BF3

    pub   rsa4096/0xD95250FB583B9F75 2019-08-10
          Key fingerprint = 2935 4AD3 C92B C970 3064  4E54 D952 50FB 583B 9F75

    pub   rsa4096/0x047EAE0E4512E127 2019-12-11
          Key fingerprint = 1A89 AF72 B3B8 C06F 967E  9AAB 047E AE0E 4512 E127
              Note: This key was revoked before transition and couldn’t be used
                    for signing

    pub   rsa4096/0xE40DFE6E993540FF 2019-12-12
          Key fingerprint = 3CC5 EA53 F4DF EFCA 568C  41A0 E40D FE6E 9935 40FF

    pub   rsa2048/0xEA4E7DECEEA050E4 2021-01-01
          Key fingerprint = 6A4E 43C0 8F65 D6DA 8945  BFA2 EA4E 7DEC EEA0 50E4

The new key:

    pub   rsa4096/0xF0A49E6D84E6EEBE 2021-07-11
          Key fingerprint = D836 4910 9830 AF99 BD41  C9D2 F0A4 9E6D 84E6 EEBE

Note that only the certifying subkeys are mentioned.


I have also decided for a keyserver to host my keys at. From now on, every
update of my primary key will be published on keys.openpgp.org. To fetch my new
primary key, you can simply execute:

    gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 0xF0A49E6D84E6EEBE

You can check the signature on this document by running:

    gpg --check-sigs 0xF0A49E6D84E6EEBE

For extra security, you can compare the fingerprint of the new key with the one
listed above:

    gpg --fingerprint 0xF0A49E6D84E6EEBE

If you are satisfied that you’ve got the right key, and the UIDs match what you
expect, I’d appreciate it if you would sign my key. You can issue a local-only 
signature with `--lsign-key` or a public signature with `--sign-key`. If you
do the latter, I’d like to have the key sent my way via e-mail. For this, use
the address of the primary UID.


Please let me know if you have any questions, or problems. I apologize for the
inconvenience.
