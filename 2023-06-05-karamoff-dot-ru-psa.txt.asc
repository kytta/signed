As of today, I am not in control of karamoff(dot)ru any more.

Back in 2019, I have announced moving my primary domain address of the time,
karamoff(dot)ru to karamoff.dev. I have also announced that the .RU domain
would remain in an "LTS" state until 2023 [1]. Since then, I have moved all my
websites and services to karamoff.dev and later to kytta.dev.

Over the last year or more, karamoff(dot)ru was not used at all. 9th May 2023
was the registration end of the domain, and I did not renew it.

Any links targeted to that domain are not associated with me any longer.
