# OpenPGP signed documents

This repository holds public documents signed by me using OpenPGP. The documents
are signed with the key actual at the time of signing. If a key gets updated,
the messages get re-signed.

**My current OpenPGP key** can be found on Keyoxide:
<https://keyoxide.org/me@kytta.dev>

Alternatively, you can fetch the keys from the source control sites:

 - <https://codeberg.org/kytta.gpg>
 - <https://github.com/kytta.gpg>
 - <https://gitlab.com/kytta.gpg>

The metadata of these keys can be outdated, but the fingerprints will match.
